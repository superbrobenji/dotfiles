description: Label plan todos with execution mode (SERIAL/PARALLEL) and dispatch subagents accordingly during implementation. Use when creating multi-step plans, organizing complex tasks into layers, or deciding whether to parallelize work across subagents.

# Task Parallelism Protocol

Apply these principles from [Google Research's agent scaling study](https://research.google/blog/towards-a-science-of-scaling-agent-systems-when-and-why-agent-systems-work/) when creating or executing plans with multiple todos.

## When planning: label every todo

Tag each todo with an execution mode prefix:

- `SERIAL L<n>` — must run sequentially by the main agent
- `PARALLEL L<n> Agent<X>` — can run as a subagent, grouped with others sharing the same agent letter

### When to use SERIAL

- Tasks that establish contracts others depend on (types, schemas, shared constants)
- Tasks with high shared-context density (multiple tasks referencing the same rubric, prompt structure, or interface)
- Tasks with cross-cutting concerns (reading from multiple shared tables, wiring multiple modules together)
- Final integration points

### When to use PARALLEL

- Tasks that produce independent files with no cross-dependencies
- Tasks that import only from frozen/completed modules
- Tasks that query different data sources with no shared state

### The alignment test

Ask: "If two agents did these tasks simultaneously without communicating, would the outputs be consistent?" If yes, PARALLEL. If no, SERIAL.

Key findings:
- Parallelizable tasks see up to **+81%** improvement with multi-agent coordination
- Sequential tasks degrade **-39% to -70%** when parallelised (the "sequential penalty")
- Independent agents (no review) amplify errors **17.2x**; centralized review contains it to **4.4x**

## When executing: follow the labels

1. Complete all todos in layer N before starting layer N+1
2. For SERIAL todos within a layer, execute them in listed order
3. For PARALLEL todos, dispatch subagents grouped by their Agent letter (max 3-4 concurrent)
4. After parallel subagents complete, review their output for type/interface consistency before proceeding
5. If a parallel agent's output conflicts with another's, fix it before moving to the next layer

## Layer template

```
L1 Foundation   — SERIAL   (types, schemas, shared constants)
L2 Core modules — PARALLEL (independent implementations importing from L1)
L3 Integration  — SERIAL   (tests, wiring, modules that reference multiple L2 outputs)
L4 Composition  — SERIAL   (configs that wire L2+L3 together)
L5 Data/IO      — PARALLEL (independent data queries, seeders, migrations)
L6 Verification — SERIAL   (cross-cutting checks, outcome analysis)
L7 Wiring       — SERIAL   (job registration, final integration)
```

Not every plan needs all 7 layers. Scale to fit — a 3-todo plan needs no layer annotations.
